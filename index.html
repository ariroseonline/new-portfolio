			<h2>College</h2>
			<p>Studied Experimental Psychology, Philosophy, Music and one course in just about every department.</p>
			<p>Read a lot of books, acquired writing skills and (overly) critical thinking, lived in Vienna, joined a fraternity as an exercise in investigative journalism, and made a documentary. The liberal arts are still alive!</p>
			<p>How does this relate to the matter at hand: Understanding and solving business and programming problems is not nearly as forehead-bruising as dealing with Kant and Hegel. And music theory is basically like design with sound.</p>

			<Breed Breakdown>
			<p>Developed CSS and presentational JS agility by coding other students' custom portfolios. These were crazy designs with even crazier pixel-perfection demands across devices.</p>

		<h2>Internship</h2>
		<p>Learn the ropes of the advertising and branding busines at Anomaly. Worked on Budweiser and Converse accounts.</p>

		<p>But I would be transitioning into building dynamic applications.</p>

		<h2>Consulting</h2>
		<p>Realizing I needed a deeper set of coding skills to accomplish bigger projects, I spent a year studying CS, backend development, and the Javascript language. I went through hundreds of books, video courses, and tutorials (this was before Bootcamps).  I lived in Atlanta in a $250/mo apartment while freelancr consulting on UX, digital stategy, and web design projects, which helped me hone those skillsets.</p>

		I was even on a reality show.

		<h2>Then a rare opportunity came up. To help start a school from scratch. I had to take it.</h2>
		<p>Avi Flombaum (Dean), Adam Enbar (President) and I (Campus Director) worked out butts off to prove that you can teach the foundations of coding in 12 weeks. We had 20 ambitious and brave students in the inaugural class. I was doing things every day that I've never done before. Employer outreach for hiring <picture of Flatiron deck>,  conducting admissions for the next class <skype>, and establishing up a Marketing and CRM system for both <Hubspot and Salesforce>. Also, functioning as programming and design tutor, event planner <picture of me sleeping after organizing our first hiring day>, brand manager <Flatiron branding before and after>, and social media manager <picture of group, and/or picture of card> and office manager, open to close everyday <picture of something related?>. A lot of managing, apparently.></p>

		<h2>After a huge success and sigh of relief. <picture of card>, I realized I really wanted to continue where I left off on my path to mastering web development.</h2>
		<p>I built my first production-scale front-ends at Universum.</p>
